# Authentication Pages Setup

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **React Router Installation**
- Installed `react-router-dom` for client-side routing

### 2. **Login Page** (`/login`)
**Features:**
- Email and password input fields
- "Remember me" checkbox
- "Forgot password?" link
- Social login options (Google, Facebook)
- Link to signup page
- Fully responsive design
- Form validation
- Purple theme (#9a00ff) matching navbar

**Access:** Click "Sign In" button in navbar

### 3. **Signup Page** (`/signup`)
**Features:**
- **Two-step registration process:**
  - Step 1: Account information (name, email, password)
  - Step 2: Plan selection (Starter, Business, Professional)
- Progress indicator showing current step
- Plan comparison with pricing
- "Popular" badge on recommended plan
- Terms of service checkbox
- Social signup options (Google, Facebook)
- Link to login page

**Access:** Click "Get Started" button in navbar

### 4. **Navigation Updates**
- Added React Router navigation
- "Sign In" button → routes to `/login`
- "Get Started" button → routes to `/signup`
- Works on both desktop and mobile menus
- Buttons maintain purple theme (#9a00ff)

## 🎯 Button Differences

- **Action:** New account creation + plan purchase
